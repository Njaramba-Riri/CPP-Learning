## C++ Learning Journey

Hello there! I'm thrilled that you've stopped by my repo. Here, I'll be diving into the world of C++, a powerful and versatile high-level programming language!.

**Why C++?, Why Now?**

My first encounter with C++ was during my first year at Technical University of Kenya. Our lecturer would assign us coding tasks that we had to complete manually - yes, you heard that right, writing code on paper! And the language of choice? C++. Fast forward to 2024, as a Machine Learning Engineer passionate about AI systems and keen interest in technological advancements, I recognize C++'s potential to significantly enhance my career path. Its performance and efficiency, particularly in computationally intensive tasks often encountered in Machine Learning, makes it an invaluable asset.

**Contributions**

This repository serves as a record of my C++ learning journey, documenting my progress, challenges, and ultimately, mastery of this language. While primarily dedicated to my personal growth, I welcome contributions with open and warm hands. Whether it is correcting my `helloworld` code or sharing valuable resources, any support would be highly appreciated. Ideally, I envision a collaborative environment where mentors and peers can guide my learning, making this journey even more enriching and interesting!.

**Join my Quest!**

Whether you're a seasoned C++ developer or a fellow learner, I invite you to explore this repository. Witness my learning curve, contribute your expertise, and embark on this adventure with me.
