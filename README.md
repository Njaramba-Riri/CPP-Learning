## C++ Learning Journey

Welcome to my repository dedicated to my journey into the world of C++, a powerful and versatile high-level programming language!

**Why C++?**

My first encounter with C++ was during my first year at Technical University of Kenya, where we tackled code assignments by hand. While challenging, it instilled a spark of interest in this language's unique capabilities. Fast forward to 2024, as a Machine Learning Engineer passionate about AI and technological advancements, I recognize C++'s potential to significantly enhance my career path. Its performance and efficiency, particularly in computationally intensive tasks often encountered in Machine Learning, makes it an invaluable asset.

**Learning Approach:**

This repository serves as a record of my C++ learning journey, documenting my progress, challenges, and ultimately, mastery of this language. While primarily dedicated to my personal growth, I welcome contributions from others. From correcting my early "hello world" code to sharing valuable resources, any support is appreciated. Ideally, I envision a collaborative environment where mentors and peers can guide my learning, making this journey even more enriching.

**Join my Quest!**

Whether you're a seasoned C++ developer or a fellow learner, I invite you to explore this repository. Witness my learning curve, contribute your expertise, and embark on this adventure with me. Remember, the C++ world awaits us!
